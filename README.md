# Caesar-Cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar Cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a right shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. Deciphering is done in reverse, with a left shift of 3.
